Use of Sender’s IP in ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
In the ARP protocol, the sender's IP address is used for:
1.Identifying the Source
The sender’s IP address in an ARP request helps the receiver know who is asking for a MAC address.

2. Updating ARP Cache
When an ARP reply is received, the sender’s IP and MAC are stored in the receiver’s ARP table.

3.Preventing Duplicate IPs
ARP replies allow devices to detect conflicts if another device already has the same IP.

4.Facilitating Two-Way Communication
Once the MAC address is resolved using the sender’s IP, data packets can be sent back to the sender.
