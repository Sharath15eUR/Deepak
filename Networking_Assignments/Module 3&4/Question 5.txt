Short description about Linux kernel's handling of Ethernet devices and network interfaces 

Ethernet devices in Linux are represented as network interfaces (e.g., eth0, enp0s8) managed by the kernel. 
The kernel interacts with Ethernet hardware using network drivers that follow the netdev framework. 
Packet transmission and reception are handled via the kernel's networking stack, which processes data through layers like IP and TCP/UDP.
The kernel assigns a unique MAC address to each Ethernet interface, enabling device identification on a network.
IP configuration (static/DHCP) is managed through kernel networking utilities like ip and ifconfig.
The kernel maintains an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for efficient packet forwarding.
The kernel's routing table determines how packets are forwarded based on destination addresses and defined routes.
