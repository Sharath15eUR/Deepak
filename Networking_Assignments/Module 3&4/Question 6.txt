Steps to configure a Basic LAN Interface using ip command

In this we setup a basic LAN interface (enp0s8) with ip address as 192.168.1.10 (which should be in same subnet of other device 192.168.1.x)

Step 1: Check available network interfaces:
	ip a
Step 2: Assign a static IP address to an interface (e.g., enp0s8)
	sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev enp0s8
Step 3: Bring the interface up:
	sudo ip link set enp0s8 up
Step 4: Set the default gateway:
	sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
Step 5: Verify the IP configuration
	ip addr show enp0s8
Step 6: Verify the routing table
	ip route show
Step 7: Test connectivity using ping
	ping 192.168.1.20

These changes will reset after system reboot.To make the changes permanent configure netplan file
