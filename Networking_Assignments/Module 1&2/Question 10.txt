Various steps in DHCP

1. DHCP Discover
Client Broadcasts:
When a device connects to the network, it sends a DHCP Discover message to find available DHCP servers.

2.DHCP Offer
Server Responds:
The DHCP server replies with a DHCP Offer message containing:
Available IP Address
Subnet Mask
Gateway IP
DNS Server

3.DHCP Request
Client Confirms:
The client chooses one offer and sends a DHCP Request back to the server, asking for the offered IP.

4.DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
Final Confirmation:
The server sends DHCP ACK, confirming the IP lease.

Now the client can use the IP address for communication.
