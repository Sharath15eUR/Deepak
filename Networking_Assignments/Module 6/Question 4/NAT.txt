How NAT Handles Private IPs?
Private IPs cannot be routed on the internet. NAT (Network Address Translation) converts private IPs into a public IP for internet access.

Example NAT Process:
Before NAT: 192.168.10.5 → Private IP
After NAT: 200.0.0.3 → Public IP
Internet sees the request coming from 200.0.0.3, not 192.168.10.5.

NAT Types:
1. Static NAT – One-to-one mapping between private & public IPs.
2. Dynamic NAT – Private IPs are assigned public IPs dynamically.
3. PAT (Port Address Translation) – Multiple private IPs share a single public IP (most common).
