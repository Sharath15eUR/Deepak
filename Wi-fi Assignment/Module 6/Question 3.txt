3. Explain the differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.

1. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):

-It was introduced 1997 (original 802.11 standard)
-Encryption: RC4 stream cipher with 40 or 104-bit key + 24-bit IV
-Security: Very weak â€“ can be cracked in minutes using basic tools

2. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):

-It was introduced in 2003 as a temporary fix for WEP
-Encryption: TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) and RC4
-Authentication: WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) or WPA-Enterprise (802.1X)
-Security: Better than WEP but still vulnerable
-Mostly replaced by WPA2

3. WPA2:

-It was introduced in 2004 (mandatory from 2006 for WiFi certification)
-Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with CCMP (Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol)
-Authentication: WPA2-PSK or WPA2-Enterprise
-Security: Strong and widely used; vulnerable to KRACK if not patched
-Current standard in most networks

4. WPA3:

-It was introduced in 2018
-Encryption: AES with GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol); forward secrecy
-Authentication: SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) replaces PSK
-Protection against offline brute-force attacks
-Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) for open networks
-Better support for IoT and small devices
-Gradually replacing WPA2
