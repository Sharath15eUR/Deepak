6. What is the role of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in the 4-way handshake?

The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) plays a central role in the 4-way handshake process used in WiFi security protocols like WPA2 and WPA3

Role of PMK in the 4-Way Handshake:

-The PMK is a shared secret key between the client (STA) and the Access Point (AP).
-It is derived either from a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) in personal mode or from the 802.1X authentication process in enterprise mode.
-The PMK is not used directly to encrypt data. Instead, it is used to derive a new key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) during the 4-way handshake.
