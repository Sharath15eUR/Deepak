Q8. What is the difference between IEEE and WFA? 


WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance)
1. A non-profit organization that promotes Wi-Fi technology and ensures device
interoperability.
2. Certifies Wi-Fi products for compliance with IEEE 802.11 standards.
3. Responsible for Wi-Fi branding (e.g., Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E) and ensures compatibility
between different manufacturerâ€™s devices.
4. Focuses on marketing, certification, and consumer adoption.

IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
1. A global organization that develops technical standards for various technologies.
2. Responsible for creating Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11 series).
3. Does not handle certification of Wi-Fi products.
4. Covers multiple domains, including networking, electronics, AI, and communications.
