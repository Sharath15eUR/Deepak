1. In which OSL layer the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fits.

The Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11) operates at the Data Link Layer in the MAC sublayer, and
the Physical Layer.

Physical Layer:
• It defines the actual wireless transmission, including frequency bands,
modulation techniques, and signal encoding.
• It defines which frequency band to use such as 2.4 GHz , 5GHz.
• It is responsible for converting digital signals to Wifi signals.

Data Link Layer:
• This layer is used to identify the MAC address of the device we are trying to connect.
• Wifi operates in the MAC sublayer that consists of frame control, Error detection and
correction.
