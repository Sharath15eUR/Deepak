Q6. What are the differences between 802.11a and 802.11b? 


1. Frequency Band:
802.11a: Works in the 5 GHz frequency band.
802.11b: Works in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.

2. Data Transfer Speed:
802.11a: A maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.
802.11b: A maximum data rate of 11 Mbps.

3. Range:
802.11a: Shorter range because of the 5 GHz frequency, which penetrates walls and obstructions less effectively.
802.11b: Longer range because the 2.4 GHz frequency has a longer range and can penetrate obstacles more effectively.

4. Interference:
802.11a: Less susceptible to interference because the 5 GHz band is less crowded than 2.4 GHz.
802.11b: More susceptible to interference because numerous other devices (such as microwaves, Bluetooth, and cordless phones) also operate on the 2.4 GHz band.

5. Compatibility:
802.11a: Not compatible with 802.11b devices because they operate on different frequency bands.
802.11b: May be used with existing devices but slower than 802.11a.
