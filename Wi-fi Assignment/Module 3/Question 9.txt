9. What is the difference between MIMO and MU-MIMO? 

MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output):

-MIMO is a wireless technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to send and receive more data simultaneously.
-It improves data rate, signal reliability, and range by creating multiple spatial data streams.
-MIMO boosts speed and reliability for individual devices using multiple antennas.

Example: A 4x4 MIMO system can send four independent streams of data at once, increasing throughput.

Used In: 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 4/5/6)

MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO):

-MU-MIMO is an advanced form of MIMO that allows multiple users to receive separate data streams simultaneously from the same access point.
-Instead of serving users one at a time (like in SU-MIMO), MU-MIMO can serve multiple clients at once, improving network efficiency.
-MU-MIMO builds on this by allowing simultaneous communication with multiple devices, making Wi-Fi more scalable and efficient, especially in busy networks.

Used In: Introduced in 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5, downlink) and enhanced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6, uplink & downlink)
