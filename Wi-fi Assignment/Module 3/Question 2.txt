2. What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work?

Both DSSS and FHSS are spread spectrum techniques used to improve signal reliability and reduce interference in wireless communication.

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS):

-Converts each bit into a sequence (chipping code) which spreads the signal.
-Enhances resistance to interference and jamming.
-Used in 802.11b, it provides robustness and consistent performance.

Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS):

-Signal rapidly hops across different frequencies within a band.
-Reduces the chance of signal collision.
-Was part of the original 802.11 standard but is rarely used in modern Wi-Fi.
