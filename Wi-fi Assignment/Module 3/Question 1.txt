1. What are the different 802.11 PHY layer standards? Compare their characteristics.

The IEEE 802.11 standards define the physical (PHY) and MAC layers of wireless local area networks (WLANs). Over time, multiple amendments have introduced enhancements in speed, efficiency, and reliability.

Various IEEE 802.11 standards are:

-802.11: Original, up to 2 Mbps using FHSS/DSSS.

-802.11a: Uses OFDM at 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps.

-802.11b: DSSS at 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps.

-802.11g: OFDM at 2.4 GHz, up to 54 Mbps.

-802.11n: MIMO, dual-band, up to 600 Mbps.

-802.11ac: MU-MIMO, 256-QAM, 5 GHz, gigabit speeds.

-802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6): OFDMA, improved MU-MIMO, up to 9.6 Gbps.
