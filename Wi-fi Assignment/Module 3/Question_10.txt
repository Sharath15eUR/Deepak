10. What are PPDU, PLCP, and PMD in the PHY layer? 

The IEEE 802.11 Physical (PHY) layer is divided into the following sublayers, each playing a specific role in wireless transmission:

-PPDU (PLCP Protocol Data Unit)
-PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol)
-PMD (Physical Medium Dependent)

These components work together to convert MAC frames into actual radio signals and transmit them over the wireless medium.

PPDU (PLCP Protocol Data Unit):

-Think of the PPDU as the final "transmission packet" that includes everything the receiver needs to synchronize, decode, and extract the MAC layer data.
-It is the complete frame that is transmitted over the air by the PHY layer.
-It prepares the MAC frame for wireless transmission by adding necessary PHY headers and training sequences.

Contains: Preamble, PHY header, and the MAC frame as payload.


PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol):

-PLCP acts as the bridge between the digital MAC frame and the physical radio signal, organizing the transmission structure and synchronization information.
-Serves as an interface between the MAC layer and the PMD sublayer.

Functions:

-Adds preamble and PHY headers to create the PPDU.
-Provides timing and format information to help the receiver interpret the signal.
-Converts MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) into PPDU.


PMD (Physical Medium Dependent)

-PMD is the hardware-facing part of the PHY layer—it’s responsible for the radio and electrical characteristics of transmission and reception.
-Handles the actual transmission and reception of radio signals through antennas.

Functions:

-Converts bits into RF signals (modulation).
-Handles frequency selection, signal power, modulation/demodulation, etc.
-Communicates directly with the physical medium (air).
