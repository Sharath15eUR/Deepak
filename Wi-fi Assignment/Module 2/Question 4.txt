Lightweight APs vs Cloud-Based APs

1.Lightweight APs

-Managed by an on-premises Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
-Relies on the CAPWAP protocol for AP-WLC communication.
-Offloads tasks like authentication, security, and traffic management to the WLC.
-Used in large enterprises, campuses, and high-performance networks.
-Offers seamless roaming, efficient bandwidth management, and centralized control.
-Requires dedicated WLC hardware, increasing infrastructure costs.
-Better security as management remains within the organization's network.

2.Cloud-Based APs

-Managed via a cloud controller hosted on the internet.
-No need for on-premises WLC, reducing hardware costs.
-Can be configured and monitored remotely via a web dashboard or mobile app.
-Ideal for distributed networks, branch offices, and businesses with multiple locations.
-Automatic updates and security patches handled by the cloud provider.
-Depends on internet connectivity for management, which can be a limitation in unstable networks.
-Highly scalable, as adding new APs does not require additional controllers.
