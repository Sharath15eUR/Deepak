Components of Split MAC Architecture

1.Lightweight Access Point (AP)

Also called Thin AP or Controller-based AP.
Handles only real-time MAC functions like frame transmission, beacon generation, and roaming.
Offloads complex functions to the WLC.
Cannot operate independentlyâ€”it requires a WLC to function.

2.Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)

A centralized device that manages multiple APs.
Handles high-level MAC functions like authentication, encryption, QoS, and mobility management.
Optimizes bandwidth allocation and load balancing.

3.Control and Data Planes

Control Plane (Management Traffic)
Used for AP-WLC communication.
Includes authentication, policy enforcement, and configuration updates.

Data Plane (User Traffic)
Handles actual data transmission between client devices and the network.


How Split MAC Improves AP Performance

1.Reduces AP Processing Load
APs offload encryption, authentication, and QoS tasks to the WLC.
This allows APs to focus on fast packet transmission.

2.Better Scalability
Centralized management by WLC makes it easier to scale multiple APs.
Reduces overhead on individual APs.

3.Improved Roaming & Seamless Handover
The WLC handles client roaming decisions, ensuring smooth transitions between APs.

4.Enhanced Security
The WLC enforces centralized security policies, reducing vulnerabilities at the AP level.

5.Efficient Resource Management
The WLC manages bandwidth allocation, interference control, and load balancing.
