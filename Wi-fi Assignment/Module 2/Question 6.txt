Sniffer Mode vs Monitor Mode

Both Sniffer Mode and Monitor Mode are used for wireless packet analysis, but they serve different purposes and function differently.

1. Sniffer Mode

-The AP acts as a packet capture device and forwards all captured frames to a remote system (like Wireshark) for analysis.
-The AP does not serve clients in this mode.
-Captures only 802.11 frames for a specific channel and sends them to a network analyzer.
-Used primarily for troubleshooting and performance analysis in an enterprise network.

Use Case:
Performance troubleshooting, network optimization

2.Monitor Mode

-The AP (or wireless adapter) captures all packets in the air without associating with an access point.
-Works at the physical layer, meaning it captures management, control, and data frames.
-Can capture all traffic on all SSIDs within range (not just a specific network).
-Often used for wireless security analysis, penetration testing, and intrusion detection.

Use Case:
Security audits, intrusion detection, wireless hacking
