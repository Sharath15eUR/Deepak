CAPWAP operates at multiple layers of the OSI model:

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
-Used for AP-WLC communication when operating on the same subnet (rare case).

Layer 3 (Network Layer)
-CAPWAP typically runs over UDP (IPv4/IPv6) and supports AP-WLC communication across different subnets.

Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
-Uses UDP ports 5246 (Control Tunnel) and 5247 (Data Tunnel) for communication.

Layer 7 (Application Layer)
-WLC manages AP configuration, policy enforcement, and data processing.


CAPWAP operates using two logical channels:

1.Control Tunnel

UDP port - UDP 5246

-Used for management traffic (AP-WLC communication, configuration, authentication). Encrypted for security.
-Handles AP discovery, authentication, configuration, and firmware updates.
-Encrypted using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).

2.Data Tunnel

UDP port - UDP 5247

-Used for transmitting user data (packets from clients to the network). May or may not be encrypted.
-Can either be centrally forwarded to WLC (Tunnel Mode) or locally switched (FlexConnect Mode).
-Optional Encryption, based on configuration.
