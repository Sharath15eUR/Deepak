CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol used to manage communication between Lightweight Access Points (APs) and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). It allows APs to be centrally controlled, reducing the processing load on APs and improving network efficiency.

Features of CAPWAP:

-Allows remote AP management from a centralized WLC.
-Uses encryption to secure communication between AP and WLC.
-Reduces overhead on APs, making them more efficient.
-Supports Layer 3 communication, meaning APs and WLCs can be in different subnets.


Packet flow between AP and controller

1.AP Discovery
The AP searches for a WLC using methods like:
Preconfigured WLC IP address.
DHCP Option 43 (WLC IP is provided by the DHCP server).
DNS Resolution (CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.local).
Once the AP finds the WLC, it sends a Discovery Request.
The WLC responds with a Discovery Response.

2.AP Join Process
The AP sends a Join Request to the WLC.
The WLC verifies the AP and responds with a Join Response.
A secure Control Tunnel is established using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).

3.AP Configuration
The AP requests firmware updates (if needed).
The WLC sends configuration settings (SSID, VLANs, RF parameters).
AP applies the configuration and is ready to serve clients.

4.Data Transmission
A Data Tunnel is established between the AP and WLC.
User traffic is forwarded to the WLC (in centralized mode) or directly routed (in local mode).

5.AP Keep-Alive & Roaming
The AP sends Keep-Alive messages to the WLC to confirm it is active.
If a client moves to another AP, the WLC handles seamless roaming.
