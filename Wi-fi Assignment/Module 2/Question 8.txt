Challenges of Deploying Autonomous (Standalone) APs in a Large Network
Deploying standalone APs across a large network, such as a university, comes with several challenges due to the absence of centralized management and coordination.

1. Scalability Challenges

-Manual Configuration: Each AP requires individual setup and ongoing management.
-Firmware Management: Updating firmware across multiple APs is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.
-Authentication Issues: Enforcing uniform security policies (e.g., WPA3, 802.1X) across all APs is difficult.

2. Lack of Centralized Control

-Inconsistent Settings: APs may have conflicting SSIDs, security configurations, or frequency settings.
-Limited Network Visibility: Troubleshooting issues such as interference or client distribution is challenging without centralized monitoring.
-Rogue AP Detection: No unified system to identify unauthorized access points on the network.

3. Roaming Inefficiencies

-Connectivity Drops: Devices may experience disruptions when moving between APs due to lack of seamless roaming.
-Disjointed User Experience: Users may need to reconnect when switching between APs with different SSIDs or security settings.

4. Security Risks

-Decentralized Policy Enforcement: Access control lists (ACLs) and authentication mechanisms must be manually configured on each AP.
-Increased Vulnerability: Detecting and mitigating security threats like spoofing and deauthentication attacks is more difficult.

5. Network Performance Issues

-No Load Balancing: Some APs may become overloaded while others remain underutilized.
-Channel Interference: Without coordination, APs may operate on overlapping channels, degrading performance.
-Lack of QoS: Traffic prioritization for critical applications is not efficiently managed.

6. Maintenance Challenges

-No Remote Management: Each AP must be accessed individually via IP or physical connection for troubleshooting.
-Time-Consuming Diagnostics: Identifying and resolving issues like latency, packet loss, or interference requires significant manual effort.

7. Increased Operational Costs

-Higher Staffing Needs: More network administrators are required to manage APs individually.
-Longer Downtime: The absence of centralized troubleshooting tools results in slower issue resolution
