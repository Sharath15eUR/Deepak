1. What is the significance of MAC layer and in which position it is placed in the OSI model ?

POSITION OF MAC LAYER:

MAC Layer is placed in Layer 2 - DATA LINK LAYER in OSI Model.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MAC LAYER:
 
a. Channel Access Control

-It manages how devices access the wireless medium, avoiding collisions.
-Uses techniques like CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) in Wi-Fi.

b. Frame Construction & Addressing

-Builds MAC frames with source and destination MAC addresses.
-Ensures that data is directed to the correct device.

c. Reliable Delivery

-Handles acknowledgments (ACKs), retries, and retransmissions to ensure that frames are delivered reliably over a potentially error-prone wireless medium.

d. Security

-Responsible for encryption and decryption using protocols like WPA2/WPA3 at the frame level.

e. QoS and Traffic Management

-Implements Quality of Service (QoS) using mechanisms like EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access), giving priority to voice/video traffic
