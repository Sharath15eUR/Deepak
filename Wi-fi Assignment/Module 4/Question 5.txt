5. Brief about Client Association process

The client (STA) association process is essential for a wireless device to discover and join a Wi-Fi network. It involves several coordinated steps between the STA and Access Point (AP):

1. Scanning – Network Discovery Phase

The process begins with the STA scanning for available networks:
-Passive Scanning: The STA listens for periodic Beacon frames sent by nearby APs, which advertise their SSID and capabilities.
-Active Scanning: The STA sends out Probe Request frames to actively search for APs. APs that receive this request respond with Probe Response frames containing network information.

2. Probe Request – Client Initiated Search

-The STA broadcasts a Probe Request to locate nearby access points.
-It may include a specific SSID (for known networks) or use a broadcast SSID to discover all available APs.
-It also includes supported features like data rates and capabilities.

3. Probe Response – AP’s Advertisement

-In response to a probe request, the AP sends a Probe Response frame.
-This response contains details such as the SSID, supported data rates, security features (like WPA/WPA2), and other operational capabilities.
-The STA uses this to decide which AP to connect with.

4. Authentication – Establishing Initial Trust

-After selecting a preferred AP, the STA initiates authentication:
   -It sends an Authentication Request frame.
   -The AP replies with an Authentication Response.

Depending on the network, this could be Open System (no real verification) or Shared Key (requires credentials like a password).

5. Association – Network Joining

-Once authentication is successful, the STA proceeds to associate:
   -It sends an Association Request frame with its supported capabilities.
   -The AP evaluates this and replies with an Association Response frame.

Upon success, the STA receives an Association ID (AID) and becomes part of the WLAN.

6. Data Transmission – Start of Communication

-After successful association, the STA can now send and receive data across the wireless network.
-In secured networks (e.g., WPA2/WPA3), a 4-Way Handshake is performed next to establish encryption keys before data exchange.
