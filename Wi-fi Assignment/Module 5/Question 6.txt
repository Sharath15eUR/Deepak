6. What are the major innovations introduced in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)?

Major innovations in Wi-fi 7 :

Wider Channels:
Wi-Fi 7 provides channels of 320 MHz, double the bandwidth of Wi-Fi 6 (160 MHz), which results in far greater data transfer speeds.

4K-QAM:
This enhanced modulation method packs more data in each symbol, further increasing data transfer speed.

Multi-Link Operation (MLO):
MLO allows for devices to have multiple links to operate at once, enhancing throughput and minimizing latency, particularly in crowded environments.

Multiple Resource Unit (MRU):
MRU enables more effective resource management and scheduling, which results in enhanced performance and lower latency.

6 GHz Band Support:
Wi-Fi 7 still supports the 6 GHz band, offering a broader range of frequencies with less interference, resulting in faster and more stable connections.

Enhanced Efficiency:
Wi-Fi 7 includes several optimizations to improve the efficiency of the network, such as improvements in MU-MIMO and OFDMA technology.

Higher Throughput
These technologies combined enable Wi-Fi 7 to deliver data rates much greater than its predecessors, with some estimates predicting speeds of over 30 Gbps
