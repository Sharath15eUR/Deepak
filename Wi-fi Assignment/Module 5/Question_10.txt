10. How do 802.11k/v/r work together to provide seamless roaming in enterprise networks?

1.802.11k: Neighbor Discovery and Optimized Roaming Target Selection
-802.11k supplies the client with a neighbor report of close APs and channel details.
-This makes it easier for the client to not have to scan through all available channels to look for a better AP.
-The client is able to then choose the optimal AP efficiently from the neighbor report, decreasing roaming latency and time.

2.802.11r: Fast Roaming with Fast Transition
-802.11r enables Fast Basic Service Set Transition (FT), in which the client is able to authenticate and associate with the target AP in less time.
-FT has a pre-authentication process whereby the client and target AP send information prior to actual handover.
-This decreases the time required for re-authentication and re-association when roaming, causing minimal disruption.

3.802.11v: Network-Driven Roaming
-802.11v provides for the capability of the network to control client roaming behavior by way of BSS Transition Management (BTM).
-The network can make suggestions to the client, recommending which AP to roam to, depending on network utilization, signal quality, and so on.
-This ensures clients roam to the most appropriate AP, maximizing overall network performance and reducing disturbances
