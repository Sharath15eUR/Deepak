Wi-fi 6 and 6E:

-IEEE 802.11ax
-Bands : 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz
-Data rate : 9.6Gbps
-Channel Bandwidths: 20,40,80,160 MHz
-1024 QAM

-Key features:
   -Best in class WPA3 security
   -UL and DL MU-MIMO OFDMA
   -Target wait time(TWT)


Wi-fi 7:

-IEEE 802.11be
-Bands : 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz
-Data rate : 46 Gpbs
-Channel Bandwidth : 20,40,80,160,320 MHz
-4096 QAM

-Key features:
   -Multi-link operation
   -Mutli-RU and puncturing
   -managed Qos and restricted service periods

When compared to Wi-fi 5, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E brought major improvements in terms of efficiency, capacity, and power saving, while Wi-Fi 7 focuses on ultra-high speeds, lower latency, and smarter spectrum usage.
