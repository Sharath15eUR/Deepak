2. Explain the role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6 and how it improves network efficiency.

In Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) plays a central role in improving the overall performance and efficiency of wireless networks. It is one of the key technologies that differentiates Wi-Fi 6 from previous standards.

-OFDMA divides a wireless channel into subchannels, allowing multiple devices to transmit data simultaneously, increasing network efficiency.
-A critical difference between OFDM and OFDMA is that OFDM transmits to a single user, while Wi-Fi OFDMA allows multiple simultaneous users by allocating subsets of subcarriers.
-OFDMA enhances throughput, capacity, quality of service, and efficiency in high-density environments like offices and malls by servicing many clients simultaneously.
-While complex, OFDMA provides high throughput, low latency, and continued advancements for future wireless networking.


Attributes that improves network efficiency:

High throughput
OFDMA's innovations allow radio waves to carry more data in shorter timeframes.

Low latency
OFDMA reduces response times and enhances performance for video, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual- and augmented-reality applications.

IoT optimization
OFDMA prevents Internet of Things (IoT) devices from using disproportionate network resources.

More-efficient power consumption
OFDMA allows per-channel or per-subchannel power and lower maximal transmission power for low-data-rate users, eliminating pulsed carriers and conserving battery life in devices.
