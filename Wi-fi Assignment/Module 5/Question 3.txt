3. Discuss the benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for lot devices.

Target Wake Time (TWT) is a power-saving feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) that is particularly useful for IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

Key Benefits of TWT for IoT Devices

Extended Battery Life
-IoT devices like sensors, smart locks, or wearables can sleep longer and only wake up at scheduled intervals.
-This dramatically reduces power consumption, which is essential for battery-powered devices.

Scheduled Communication
-With TWT, devices agree with the AP on when to send or receive data.
-Helps avoid unnecessary contention for airtime and ensures predictable access.

Improved Network Efficiency
-Since devices wake up at different times, it reduces collisions and channel congestion, especially in dense IoT environments.

Optimized for Low-Bandwidth Devices
-Most IoT devices send small amounts of data.
-TWT allows them to transmit data at just the right time, avoiding delays and keeping the air interface free.

Supports Scalability
-Networks with hundreds of IoT devices (like in smart homes, hospitals, or factories) can be better managed using TWT schedules.
-It ensures smooth performance even as the number of devices increases.
